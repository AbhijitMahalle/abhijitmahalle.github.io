<font size="+2"><center>I am a Robotics graduate student at the University of Maryland.</center><br>
<center>My interest lies in the field of Computer Vision and Deep Learning and I also have a strong background in Mechanical Engineering.</center><br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I have worked on numerous cool projects over the last three months. Few of them are described below:<br>

<b>1. Monocular Human Position Estimator</b><br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I have developed a software program that detects and tracks one or more human beings around a robot using a monocular camera. The software outputs the 3D positon of human beings around a robot so as to maintain a safe distance between itself and human beings while working on the factory floor. You can find the project <a href="https://github.com/abhi-mah/Monocular-Human-Position-Estimator">here</a>.<br>
<br>
<b>2. Decluttering Domestic Robot</b><br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I have developed a ROS package of a robot that declutters the house by detecting objects scattered on the house floor, picking them, and placing them at their desired location. I have used a Tiago robot for this purpose. You can find this awesome project <a href="https://github.com/abhi-mah/decluttering_domestic_robot/tree/main">here</a>.<br>
<br>
<b>3. Mars Rover</b><br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I have created a robot that can collect rock and soil samples from the Mars' surface. It has a Rocker-Bogie mechanism for the suspension system and a 6 DOF KUKA KR5 manipulator attached to the mobile base to collect the samples. You can browse for this project <a href="https://github.com/abhi-mah/mars_rover">here</a>.<br>
<br>
<center>I will keep on doing such projects in the future. Do keep visiting my page.<br>
Thank you!<br><br>
